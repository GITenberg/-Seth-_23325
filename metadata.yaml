description: '""Seth"" is a deeply moving short story by Frances Hodgson Burnett,
  the author of many beloved childhood classics, including Little Lord Fauntleroy,
  The Secret Garden and A Little Princess. A young Englishman walks into a down-on-its-luck
  Tennessee mining town, and at first the locals are reluctant to accept him. But
  before long, Seth''s selflessness has made him an important part of the community.'
